# Feedback on Final

Nice work overall. Your final project was generally easy to follow from start to finish. A few notes:
* Part of the project was to use functions to demonstrate abstraction and encapsulation. Your project didn't use functions at all.
* While you did concatenate some of your data together, it didn't aid in the analyis significantly.

Consider what this kind of analysis leads you to understand about the relationship between different variables. "So what?" is a good question to ask yourself as a next step.

Great job!
