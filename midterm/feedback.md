# Notes on the Midterm

* _Correctness    (out of 40):_ 36
* _Good Practices (out of 10):_ 9
* _Docs / Testing (out of 10):_ 10

_Details on the grading criteria for the midterm can be found on [Canvas](https://canvas.slu.edu/courses/28045/rubrics/23671)._

Note that in your docstrings, the function description line should NOT start with `>>>`. That syntax should only be used for test cases.

## Step 1
* Nice work.
* I noticed that you chose a different style for your variable names in this function. No points off for that, but it's good to be consistent.

## Step 2
* Works great. No comments.

## Step 3
* Docstrings go right after the `def` line.
* You should ahve reused your `get_rate()` function you already created rather than duplicating that code again here. I deducted 1 point from _Good Practices_ for that.

## Step 4
* You have an indenting problem here. Your function definition doesn't include all of your code in this cell.
* You have errors in your indending after `if adj_rate is none`
* `none` should be `None`
* Since this function didn't run, I took off 4 points from _Correctness_. It looks like you were on a good path, but didn't have it figured out, yet.
